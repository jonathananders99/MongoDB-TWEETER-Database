### This version is in ***MongoDB Shell*** format using ***MongoDB Compass***

### Description:
This portion is split into multiple files:
- *CollectionCreation* where the collections are created with validations.
- *Main* where functions, triggers, table updates, queries, and more are.
- *Data Insertion* files where the data is inserted. It's separated into 2 different sections, individual collections and all collections at once.

### How to Run:
1. You will need to use MongoDB Compass to connect to a cluster either online or locally
2. Copy and paste the `collectionCreation` file's text into MongoDB Compass terminal
3. Copy and paste each collection insertion one at a time from the `allDocuments` file's text into MongoDB Compass terminal (takes a while and is very laggy with the amount of documents added to each collection minus TRASHCAN)
4. Copy and paste the `main` file's text into MongoDB Compass terminal
