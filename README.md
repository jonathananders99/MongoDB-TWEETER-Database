### Project Name: *TWEETER* Using *MongoDB*

### Description:
A database based off of Twitter. Project is split into 3 different portions, each put in the respective order of creation below.
- MongoDB Shell/Compass
- PyMongo
- Node.js

 I started with the MongoDB Compass then went to Pymongo then NodeJS. Each edition I made different choices in how I would organize the databases creation and queries. As my understanding of MongoDB got better over time I improved each subsequent portion especially in speed. The final portion (NodeJS) runs everything in less than 30 seconds where the first one takes about 15-20 minutes.

Each portion is split into multiple files:
- Collection creation file where the collections are created with validations.
- Main where functions, table updates, queries, and more are.
- Data Insertion files where the data is inserted.

### How to run:
The instructions to run each of these portions are in their respective folders.
